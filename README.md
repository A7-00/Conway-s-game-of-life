# Conways-game-of-life
an OpenGL implementation of Conway's game of life and also my first repo on Github.


beware that you need to have the freeglut libraries to run.


the controls of the game are:

right button: advances the game to the next genration

left button: steps back the game to the previous genration

up button: clears the board and resets the game

home button: goes back to the main menu and resets the game
